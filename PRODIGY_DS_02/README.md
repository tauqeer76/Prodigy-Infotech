DATASET

The Titanic dataset is a renowned resource in data science, encompassing passenger details from the Titanic, such as demographic data and survival outcomes. It is frequently utilized for instructional objectives and offers a chance to delve into diverse analytical methodologies.

KNOWLEDGE ACQUIRED

I executed data cleaning processes to rectify missing values and eliminate duplicate entries. During the exploratory data analysis, I investigated the interplay among variables such as gender, passenger class, age, fare, and their influence on survival rates. The analysis revealed notable trends, including a higher survival probability for females, the effect of passenger class on survival chances, and the correlation between age and survival. The insights gained from this analysis not only shed light on the determinants of survival during the Titanic tragedy but also demonstrate the practical application of data science in extracting significant conclusions from historical data.
